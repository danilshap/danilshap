# Hi, I'm Danil 👋

## Who am I?
Backend software engineer focused on building clear, reliable systems.
I work mostly with Go and .NET, prefer simple designs, explicit logic, and code that can be explained without magic.

I care about:
- architecture and boundaries
- async and distributed flows
- correctness over cleverness
- understanding *why*, not only *how*

## What am I currently working on?
- Backend services and internal tooling
- Fintech-related systems (billing, verification, orchestration)
- Bots and automation (Telegram, background jobs)
- Side projects to explore concurrency, CQRS, messaging, and data consistency

Most of my projects start small and grow only when there is a real need.

## What tools do I use?
**Languages**
- Go
- C# (.NET)

**Databases**
- PostgreSQL
- SQL Server

**Architecture & Concepts**
- CQRS
- Async / background processing
- Messaging (RabbitMQ, Kafka – depending on context)
- Explicit state machines and flows

**Other**
- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- Telegram Bots
- SQL-first approach (migrations, sqlc, Dapper)

## How to reach me?
- GitHub Issues / Discussions
- Telegram (if you already know me)
- Or just open a PR 🙂

I’m always open to discussing architecture, trade-offs, and real-world engineering problems.
